and finally i will push it back to gihub


command i have used for fixing the issue at git prompt while saving  the chages to this file 

Error : -

warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in readme.txt.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.

Solution : - git config --global core.autocrlf false
